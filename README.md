## 📌 Project Purpose

**RentEase** is a full-stack property rental and booking platform where:

- 🏠 **Property Owners** can list rental properties with images, amenities, and pricing
- 🔍 **Tenants** can browse, search, filter, book, and pay for properties online
- 🛡️ **Admins** moderate the platform — approving/rejecting listings and managing users

The platform provides a secure, transparent rental experience with Stripe-powered payments, role-based dashboards, and real-time notifications.
